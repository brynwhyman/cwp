# 2.3.0 (Unreleased)

## Overview

#### Please note, this version is not yet released. See the [release candidate](https://www.cwp.govt.nz/developer-docs/en/2/releases_and_changelogs/cwp_2.3.0-rc1/) for information on what's planned to be released.

This upgrade includes CMS and Framework version 4.4.0.

 * [Framework 4.4.0](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-framework/blob/4.4.0/docs/en/04_Changelogs/4.4.0.md)

Upgrading to Recipe 2.3.0 is optional, but is recommended for all CWP sites.

This upgrade can be carried out by any development team familiar with SilverStripe CMS, but if you
would like SilverStripe's assistance, please let us know.

## Upgrading Instructions

In order to update an existing site to use the new basic recipe the following changes to your composer.json
can be made:

```json
"require": {
    "cwp/cwp-recipe-core": "2.3.0@stable",
    "cwp/cwp-recipe-cms": "2.3.0@stable",
    "silverstripe/recipe-blog": "1.3.0@stable",
    "silverstripe/recipe-form-building": "1.3.0@stable",
    "silverstripe/recipe-authoring-tools": "1.3.0@stable",
    "silverstripe/recipe-collaboration": "1.3.0@stable",
    "silverstripe/recipe-reporting-tools": "1.3.0@stable",
    "cwp/cwp-recipe-search": "2.3.0@stable",
    "silverstripe/recipe-services": "1.3.0@stable",
    "silverstripe/subsites": "2.3.0@stable",
    "tractorcow/silverstripe-fluent": "4.2.1@stable",
    "cwp/starter-theme": "3.0.0@stable"
},
"prefer-stable": true
```

### Major theme updates

Version 3.0.0 of the Starter and WƒÅtea themes, available with CWP 2.3.0, are updated to use Bootstrap 4.x. Please
[see the Bootstrap migration guide](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/migration/) for Bootstrap-specific changes. These updates also include an upgrade to Laravel Mix 4, along with other dependency upgrades (including Webpack 4 and
Babel 7).

If you rely on either of these themes as a base for your own, the 3.x upgrade will be a fairly significant undertaking, so you may wish to keep using the latest 2.0.x release when upgrading to CWP 2.3.0.
